=========

This is [the repository](http://github.com/the-open/frontpage) for [the Online Progressive Engagement Network's website](http://www.the-open.net/).

It's a Jekyll site, so install Jekyll with Ruby, navigate to the directory, and type `jekyll serve` to run the site locally.

There's no SASS in use but site.css uses Jekyll filters to cat the Bootstrap and fonts css.

The site is currently deployed to live.open-wide.net, which is the origin for [our Amazon CloudFront deployment](https://d1kv7h36pykzis.cloudfront.net/), which is the destination for the CNAME for [www.the-open.net](http://the-open.net).

I hope to move us over to SSL/HTTPS shortly. We'll also be doing a content review and making some pretty substantial changes to the site. The new version of the old site is just a down-payment on what's to come.
